# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on optimizing the existing Finger Reader PWA application to be more mobile-friendly with enhanced navigation, improved AI service context handling, and better search user experience. The optimization will add React Router for navigation management, enhance the AI service to maintain context across segment expansions, and improve the search bar behavior for better mobile usability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: React Router Integration

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want smooth navigation and proper browser history management, so that I can use back/forward buttons and have a native app-like experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN React Router SHALL be integrated for navigation management
2. WHEN a user navigates between different views THEN the browser history SHALL be properly maintained
3. WHEN a user uses browser back/forward buttons THEN the application SHALL respond correctly
4. WHEN the application is accessed on mobile THEN navigation SHALL feel native and responsive
5. IF the user bookmarks a specific view THEN the application SHALL load that view directly

### Requirement 2: Enhanced AI Service Context Management

**User Story:** As a user exploring content through segment expansion, I want the AI to maintain context from all previous levels, so that deeper expansions are more relevant and coherent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user expands a segment into deeper levels THEN the AI service SHALL include context from the top level to the current level
2. WHEN generating sub-segments THEN the AI SHALL consider the full hierarchical path for better relevance
3. WHEN a segment is at level 3 or deeper THEN the expansion prompt SHALL include context from all parent segments
4. IF context becomes too long THEN the system SHALL intelligently truncate while preserving key information
5. WHEN expanding segments THEN the generated content SHALL be more contextually relevant than the current implementation

### Requirement 3: Optimized Mobile Search Experience

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want an improved search experience that doesn't minimize during searches and provides clear feedback, so that I can efficiently search and control the process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts searching THEN the search bar SHALL remain visible and not minimize
2. WHEN a search request is in progress THEN a stop icon SHALL be displayed to allow cancellation
3. WHEN a user clicks the stop icon THEN the current search request SHALL be cancelled immediately
4. WHEN a search is completed successfully THEN the search bar SHALL hide automatically
5. WHEN a search fails or is cancelled THEN appropriate feedback SHALL be provided to the user
6. WHEN the search bar is active THEN it SHALL be optimized for mobile touch interactions
7. IF the user starts a new search while one is in progress THEN the previous request SHALL be cancelled automatically

### Requirement 4: Mobile-First UI Enhancements

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the interface to be optimized for touch interactions and small screens, so that I can easily use the app on my mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads on mobile THEN all interactive elements SHALL meet minimum touch target sizes (44px)
2. WHEN displaying content THEN the layout SHALL be responsive and mobile-optimized
3. WHEN users interact with segments THEN touch feedback SHALL be immediate and clear
4. IF the device orientation changes THEN the layout SHALL adapt appropriately
5. WHEN scrolling through content THEN the experience SHALL be smooth on mobile devices

### Requirement 5: PWA Navigation Enhancement

**User Story:** As a PWA user, I want enhanced navigation features that work seamlessly with the PWA installation, so that the app feels like a native mobile application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PWA is installed THEN navigation SHALL work without browser chrome
2. WHEN using the PWA in standalone mode THEN all navigation features SHALL function correctly
3. WHEN the app is launched from the home screen THEN it SHALL start at the appropriate route
4. IF the user shares a deep link THEN it SHALL open correctly in the PWA
5. WHEN navigating within the PWA THEN transitions SHALL be smooth and native-feeling
