# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an AI-powered search application that provides hierarchical text exploration. Users can search for topics and receive concise answers that can be progressively expanded for more detail through interactive text segments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a search interface on the front page, so that I can easily enter my questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a search icon and input bar prominently on the front page
2. WHEN I click on the search input bar THEN the system SHALL focus the input field for text entry
3. WHEN I type in the search input THEN the system SHALL accept text input up to reasonable character limits

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to get short AI-generated answers to my questions, so that I can quickly understand key points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter a question and submit THEN the system SHALL send the query to an AI service
2. WHEN the AI service responds THEN the system SHALL display a list of text segments
3. WHEN displaying text segments THEN each segment SHALL have a title and paragraph content with no more than 50 words in the paragraph
4. WHEN the AI service fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN processing a query THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click on text segments to get more detailed information, so that I can explore topics in depth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text segments are displayed THEN each segment SHALL be visually clickable
2. WHEN I click on a text segment THEN the system SHALL send that segment to the AI service for expansion
3. WHEN the AI expands a segment THEN the system SHALL display a new list of detailed text segments
4. WHEN displaying expanded segments THEN each segment SHALL maintain the title and paragraph structure with paragraphs limited to 50 words for readability
5. WHEN expanding fails THEN the system SHALL show an error message while preserving the current view

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want expanded text segments to also be clickable, so that I can continue exploring deeper levels of detail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN expanded text segments are displayed THEN each segment SHALL also be clickable
2. WHEN I click on an expanded segment THEN the system SHALL further expand that specific segment
3. WHEN navigating through multiple expansion levels THEN the system SHALL maintain a clear hierarchy
4. WHEN at any expansion level THEN the system SHALL allow continued exploration of any visible segment

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want a smooth and responsive interface, so that my exploration experience feels natural.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking on segments THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
2. WHEN loading expanded content THEN the system SHALL show loading states for the specific segment being expanded
3. WHEN content is loaded THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition to show the new segments
4. WHEN multiple expansions are active THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests appropriately
